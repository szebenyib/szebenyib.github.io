<h2 id="org058132c"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Many times clients are faced with the question: shall we go with ABAP reports
	or choose Fiori? Fiori is more expensive. More features, more bells and
	whistles need time to get them right, which in turn results in a higher
	number of mandays compared to an ABAP report. As such it is not always the go
	to solution and rightfully so. But there are many cases when it is well worth
	spending on Fiori and I have collected a handful of them.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf7e713" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcf7e713"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Use cases</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<div id="outline-container-org228c729" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org228c729"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Mobile access</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Many IT organizations have taken steps into the direction of making IT
processes available on mobile phones.
</p>

<p>
Just imagine that you are a responsible for approving purchase requisitions
for a certain cost center. If you were to approve that it would most likely
find you via a workitem, which would be accessible in SAP Business Workplace
(SBWP).
</p>

<p>
Let's say you are at home after a hard day's work but someone needs the
approval <b>right now</b>.
</p>

<p>
You go and fetch your laptop from your car. You power it on. Wait for it to
boot. Wait ten minutes for the regular windows update. Wait for the VPN to
connect, entering all sorts of 2FA codes. Launch SAPGUI directly or via a
link from your Outlook that again takes precious time to load. Logon to the
appropriate SAP system. Navigate to SBWP. Find the workitem and navigate
to other transactions to see if everything matches. Finally hit accept.
</p>

<p>
Enter another world, where Fiori is present. You take out your phone that is
always with you. You open the corporate browser, which seamlessly connects
via VPN without any input required from you and then you logon to Fiori
Launchpad, with the My Inbox tile on top. See the newest workitem on top with
all the necessary information listed in the details. Hit accept.
</p>

<p>
Which one would you choose?
</p>

<p>
Yes the above will most likely not work out of the box. Besides the IT
infrastructure you have to make sure that your workflow supports My Inbox and
displays the necessary data that is needed to meet the decision and handle it
as well. But you only have to do that development once and your managers will
be grateful for the comfort you provide them with.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1368fc5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1368fc5"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Focus on the process</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Have you ever worked with a transaction just to use only a
	fraction of the functionality it provides but to combat all its complexity?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it is easier from a programming perspective to group together
	activities that have far reaching capabilities. These activities require
	different fields but all of them are present to the end user on different
	tabs that keep appearing and hiding. Don't hide MIGO, I'm looking at you.
</p>

<p>
If one can instead put the end user first, focus on the process then all
	this unnecessary complexity can be avoided. With less complexity come less
	error possibilities for the end user, more transparency and as a result
	higher speed and daily efficiency.
</p>

<p>
If many users rely on processes that can be simplified this way one can
	gain an advantage that can be easily materialized.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgea26bb9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgea26bb9"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Time is money</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
This comes hand in hand with mobile access. But it is even more.
</p>

<p>
Let's imagine that you have to pay a provider a certain fee as long as their
	truck is waiting for unloading in your warehouse. That immediately highlights
	how crucial it is that the unloading process should be as foolproof and fast
	as possible.
</p>

<p>
If you use paper for this purpose you are forced to double record what is
	happening (once on paper in the field, then into the system back in the
	office). This can lead to errors.
</p>

<p>
In case you were to use a phone or a tablet to support this process you would
	be able to record in real time what is going on. You can reorder items based
	on their importance. You can check details of items on the spot. You can
	rearrange items as you go. You can scan barcodes. You can search for
	products and items during the process. And you don't have to
	record things twice.
</p>

<p>
This is again a use case that shows that Fiori development costs can be
	compensated.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org9903662" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9903662"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> No SAPGUI access</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Not all clients have access to SAPGUI, at least not all their subsidiaries.
Yet they somehow need to have access to a small set of SAP data and not just
for reporting.
</p>

<p>
Fiori can help also in that case.
</p>

<p>
How? From the ground up. Such subsidiaries know nothing of SAP terminology,
they have no SAPGUI experience but somehow they should be made aware of what
they are getting. This is easily accomplishable with the help of Fiori
wireframes. The wireframe part translates to a word file that the client may
comment. It includes screen designs of the application, including the layout,
including all fields annotated with remarks as to where the data comes from,
including functionality that is available for the end user.
</p>

<p>
The end user doesn't even have to know about SAP or Fiori. Because if the UI
has to be explained it is wrong. The solution should be intuitive and the
SAPUI5 toolkit beyond Fiori is up to the task.
</p>

<p>
After iterating with the client both the end users and the developers have a
picture of the application. One knows what to expect, while the other knows
what to deliver. Since this exploration phase can be easily split from the
development this also allows handling the two phases separately both
financially or even with different parties if need be.
</p>

<p>
As for the no SAPGUI access part the advantage of Fiori is trivial. There is
no SAPGUI to be installed and supported at the subsidiary because all is
needed is a web browser.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9dcda16" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9dcda16"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Technology makes Fiori easier</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
In certain cases the unbelievable might be true. Fiori might be cheaper than
using an ABAP report.
</p>

<p>
This is the case when using
<a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/abap/rap">RAP</a>. This technology puts
Fiori first and allows for a quicker Fiori path than ABAP. Since a lot of
metadata is built into the low layers of the app, recreating the
functionality derived from that in case of a Fiori Elements app in ABAP would
take more time.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc75681a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc75681a"><span class="section-number-3">2.6.</span> Alignment to other apps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
It is possible that a business unit uses Fiori apps. In that case offering
them non-Fiori apps will be a step back. A step back in functionality, a step
back in coherence, and overall a step back in user satisfaction.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7db60dd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7db60dd"><span class="section-number-3">2.7.</span> UI feature not available in SAPGUI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
In case one has never taken a look at what is possible in SAP Fiori, it is
definitely worth giving it a try. It may reveal areas that one has never
imagined to be possible and useful.

<h3 id="org050e92c"><span class="section-number-3">2.8.</span> Non-SAP backend</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-8">
<p>
Fiori's SAPUI5 toolkit is not SAP-only. If your data source can speak OData
you may leverage Fiori. Or go even one step further: you are not a SAP
customer and have no access to SAPUI5. You can still use openUI5 at no cost
for free with the exception of Fiori Elements.
</p>

<p>
So you can create Fiori apps even for non-SAP backends. And you can integrate
them into your landscape next to all the other Fiori apps. This really raises
the limits as to what you may achieve with Fiori.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is mobile access needed?</li>
