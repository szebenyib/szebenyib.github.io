<h2 id="org4acd4b2"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
2023 was a productive year for me. I had spent more time producing solutions
with my current knowledge than I had obtaining more know-how. Nevertheless
I could still find some time to explore new areas of SAP.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd3ca797" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd3ca797"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Projects</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd0d5689" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd0d5689"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> PPDS/OPTI</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
By far the biggest project was creating a PPDS optimizer heuristic for optimizing
production and keeping together resources that are bound to the same sales
order. This may not sound that difficult but I can assure anyone that
the complexity of the problem on hand is in extreme heights. There are
many-many smaller and bigger rules to find the right intersection of data
and processing an entangled set of graphs poses its own challenges. It took
more than half of 2023 full time to bring this solution alive and took time
from the other half as well with ad-hoc refinements of the logic.
</p>

<p>
What this project has taught me is that it is worth using ABAPGit for
tracking source code changes. I have been using git ever since I have
started my SAP career, but not when doing ABAP. However, administering
at around 60 ABAP classes along with their interfaces (long live OO) can
benefit from using git instead of relying solely on the transportation system.
Experimenting in git branches, reverting commits by a few commands is a lot
easier than manually keeping order.
</p>

<p>
The other aspect of this project is that OO design patterns (hello GOF) are
a must if you want to keep such a monster performant yet flexible. And not
just that but ABAP Unit as well. Because no consultant and no client
will be able to test the rules buried in such a multi-layered solution
it is really nice to come prepared for those details and testing them
before any real data touches them - or better yet before the productive
code is written. Using test driven development (TDD) one will think
about testability before the productive code is written and that
makes for better planned classes and applications.
</p>

<p>
So, using TDD, ABAPGit and design patterns were a good decision
retrospectively as well.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge551ecb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge551ecb"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Workflow migration from ECC to S/4</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The migration consisted of utilizing My Inbox instead of the old dedicated
app that is no longer available on S/4. I am not a workflow developer, I know
just enough as a Fiori/ABAP dev to migrate the existing workflow to My
Inbox.
</p>

<p>
This was an ugly task, since the complexity of the workflow and the utilized
'unique' solutions in it made this a challenge. Although most of the
transition is done there is still an open issue due to commit control
changing in S/4 making a previous user exit unusable leading to dumps.
</p>

<p>
The takeaway: no one can judge the depth of a mess a workflow may
hide in itself. As a result, no manday commitment can be made in such cases.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeee747e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgeee747e"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> HR Fiori apps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Developed 4 Fiori apps, of which 3 were Fiori Elements and 1 freestyle. As
a Fiori dev this was an easy task.
</p>

<p>
It was justified again that using Fiori Elements is a reasonable choice where
feasible. However, tasks that seem simple and straight forward in freestyle 
may take a lot of time in Fiori Elements. Like creating a filter
that accepts a date range but is filled with the current month as default,
hiding all other options.
</p>

<p>
And creating wireframes and mockups was justified again.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org88b14c0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org88b14c0"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> My first RAP application</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
I have been eyeing an opportunity to create an application using
the SAP Restful ABAP Programming Model and 2023 gave a chance for that.
</p>

<p>
The app itself was simple but it was a good requirement for a first
application where everything had to work. I did not like that OData V4
only worked if the draft capability was enabled. Since the app was
simple draft handling would have made it more complex that it would
have helped and as such I have resorted to a V2 service binding.
</p>

<p>
I found the technology usable (managed scenario was available, since it
was developed on a 2022 S/4) and I would be glad to work with it again
as the separation of concerns guides developers and tries to free them
from the function module-perform-thousand-line programs hell. I believe
that when the extension part of the technology will be in order we will see
more and more standard apps as well.

<h2 id="org5974c16"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Publications and presentations</h2>

<p>
I have published two articles:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a comparison between <a href="../embedded_analytics_vs_sap_bw_vs_sap_datasphere.html">EA BW and Datasphere</a></li>
<li>a managerial summary on <a href="../when_to_choose_fiori.html">when to choose Fiori</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Both of those have evolved into presentations that I have held at
conferences with SAP Hungary.
