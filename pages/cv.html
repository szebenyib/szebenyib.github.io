SAP consultant with 8 years of experience in SAP BW and SAP Fiori. At the
beginning of this period I got the opportunity to familiarize myself with SAP
BW, I have participated in a greenfield BW reporting implementation, which
has been later extended with BW-Integrated Planning into a business
planning solution. Later I have been tasked with larger and larger one man
projects, including crafting ABAP logic in the source and BW systems as well
as Analyzer reports and Web Templates. I have not only experienced one
man show projects but ones of a higher scale as well, a prominent example
being the transition of a national oil company from Excel to SAP BPC
(integrated).
I have also taken part in implementing a self-service solution tailored to the
needs of utility companies, known as SAP Multichannel Foundation for
Utilities. As it used SAPUI5 for frontend technology, this has started me on
my journey with SAPUI5/Fiori that I have put to good use in numerous other
projects.
As I had reporting experience I have also familiarized myself with CDS views
to deliver reports besides getting acquainted with other S4 related
technologies in a multi-year implementation project.

The project being a greenfield S/4HANA (2020) implementation I was
assigned the task to handle all Fiori related issues. Be it the partly basis
related Fiori frontend installation and configuration or the numeruous
issues arising from incorrectly working tiles or the analysis of backend BOPF
logic or extending CDS views, I had the chance to meet them all. Besides all
things Fiori I also implemented an interface to/from Maximo consisting of
multiple SOAP web services, which offered me an opportunity to practice
the new syntax, along with ABAP OO and ABAP Unit.
I have also developed reports based on CDS technology with different
outputs: Analytic Query, ALV with IDA and Fiori List Page. Other
developments include an Excel based up- and downloader, an iDOC sender
program towards the Pool4Tool system, an asset report based on a logical
database and a POWL based freight unit mass editor tool.
