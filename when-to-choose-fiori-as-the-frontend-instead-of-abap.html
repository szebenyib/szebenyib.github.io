<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Many times clients are faced with the question: shall we go with ABAP reports 	or choose Fiori? Fiori is more expensive. More features, more bells and 	whistles need time to get them right, which in turn results in a higher 	number of mandays compared to an ABAP report. As such it is not always the go 	to solution and rightfully so. But there are many cases when it is well worth 	spending on Fiori and I have collected a handful of them.</p>
<h1>Use cases</h1>
<h2>Mobile access</h2>
<p> 	Many IT organizations have taken steps into the direction of making IT  	processes available on mobile phones.</p>
<p> 	Just imagine that you are a responsible for approving purchase requisitions  	for a certain cost center. If you were to approve that it would most likely  	find you via a workitem, which would be accessible in SAP Business Workplace  	(SBWP).</p>
<p> 	Let's say you are at home after a hard day's work but someone needs the  	approval <b>right now</b>.</p>
<p> 	You go and fetch your laptop from your car. You power it on. Wait for it to  	boot. Wait ten minutes for the regular windows update. Wait for the VPN to  	connect, entering all sorts of 2FA codes. Launch SAPGUI directly or via a  	link from your Outlook that again takes precious time to load. Logon to the  	appropriate SAP system. Navigate to SBWP. Find the workitem and navigate  	to other transactions to see if everything matches. Finally hit accept.</p>
<p> 	Enter another world, where Fiori is present. You take out your phone that is  	always with you. You open the corporate browser, which seamlessly connects  	via VPN without any input required from you and then you logon to Fiori  	Launchpad, with the My Inbox tile on top. See the newest workitem on top with  	all the necessary information listed in the details. Hit accept.</p>
<p> 	Which one would you choose?</p>
<p> 	Yes the above will most likely not work out of the box. Besides the IT  	infrastructure you have to make sure that your workflow supports My Inbox and  	displays the necessary data that is needed to meet the decision and handle it  	as well. But you only have to do that development once and your managers will  	be grateful for the comfort you provide them with.</p>
<h2>Focus on the process</h2>
<p> Have you ever worked with a transaction just to use only a  	fraction of the functionality it provides but to combat all its complexity?</p>
<p> Sometimes it is easier from a programming perspective to group together  	activities that have far reaching capabilities. These activities require  	different fields but all of them are present to the end user on different  	tabs that keep appearing and hiding. Don't hide MIGO, I'm looking at you.</p>
<p> If one can instead put the end user first, focus on the process then all  	this unnecessary complexity can be avoided. With less complexity come less  	error possibilities for the end user, more transparency and as a result  	higher speed and daily efficiency.</p>
<p> If many users rely on processes that can be simplified this way one can  	gain an advantage that can be easily materialized.</p>
<h2>Time is money</h2>
<p> 	This comes hand in hand with mobile access. But it is even more.</p>
<p> Let's imagine that you have to pay a provider a certain fee as long as their  	truck is waiting for unloading in your warehouse. That immediately highlights  	how crucial it is that the unloading process should be as foolproof and fast  	as possible.</p>
<p> If you use paper for this purpose you are forced to double record what is  	happening (once on paper in the field, then into the system back in the  	office). This can lead to errors.</p>
<p> In case you were to use a phone or a tablet to support this process you would  	be able to record in real time what is going on. You can reorder items based  	on their importance. You can check details of items on the spot. You can  	rearrange items as you go. You can scan barcodes. You can search for  	products and items during the process. And you don't have to  	record things twice.</p>
<p> This is again a use case that shows that Fiori development costs can be  	compensated.</p>
<h2>No SAPGUI access</h2>
<p> 	Not all clients have access to SAPGUI, at least not all their subsidiaries.  	Yet they somehow need to have access to a small set of SAP data and not just  	for reporting.</p>
<p> 	Fiori can help also in that case.</p>
<p> 	How? From the ground up. Such subsidiaries know nothing of SAP terminology,  	they have no SAPGUI experience but somehow they should be made aware of what  	they are getting. This is easily accomplishable with the help of Fiori  	wireframes. The wireframe part translates to a word file that the client may  	comment. It includes screen designs of the application, including the layout,  	including all fields annotated with remarks as to where the data comes from,  	including functionality that is available for the end user.</p>
<p> 	The end user doesn't even have to know about SAP or Fiori. Because if the UI  	has to be explained it is wrong. The solution should be intuitive and the  	SAPUI5 toolkit beyond Fiori is up to the task.</p>
<p> 	After iterating with the client both the end users and the developers have a  	picture of the application. One knows what to expect, while the other knows  	what to deliver. Since this exploration phase can be easily split from the  	development this also allows handling the two phases separately both  	financially or even with different parties if need be.</p>
<p> 	As for the no SAPGUI access part the advantage of Fiori is trivial. There is  	no SAPGUI to be installed and supported at the subsidiary because all is  	needed is a web browser.</p>
<h2>Technology makes Fiori easier</h2>
<p> 	In certain cases the unbelievable might be true. Fiori might be cheaper than  	using an ABAP report.</p>
<p> 	This is the case when using  	<a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/abap/rap">RAP</a>. This technology puts  	Fiori first and allows for a quicker Fiori path than ABAP. Since a lot of  	metadata is built into the low layers of the app, recreating the  	functionality derived from that in case of a Fiori Elements app in ABAP would  	take more time.</p>
<h2>Alignment to other apps</h2>
<p> 	It is possible that a business unit uses Fiori apps. In that case offering  	them non-Fiori apps will be a step back. A step back in functionality, a step  	back in coherence, and overall a step back in user satisfaction.</p>
<h2>UI feature not available in SAPGUI</h2>
<p> 	In case one has never taken a look at what is possible in SAP Fiori, it is  	definitely worth giving it a try. It may reveal areas that one has never  	imagined to be possible and useful.</p>
<p> 	Check out:  	- the <a href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/">Fiori apps reference library</a>  	- the <a href="https://ui5.sap.com/controls">UI5 toolkit</a>  	- the <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/explore/">Fiori Design Guidelines</a>  	for ideas.</p>
<p> 	- Maps?  	- 3D object visualization?  	- All types of charts imaginable?  	- Multiple diagrams combined on the same page?  	- Graphs and charts on the same page?  	- Wizard like process flows?  	- Network graphs?  	- T account representations?</p>
<p> The SAPUI5 toolkit will have you covered.</p>
<h2>Non-SAP backend</h2>
<p> 	Fiori's SAPUI5 toolkit is not SAP-only. If your data source can speak OData  	you may leverage Fiori. Or go even one step further: you are not a SAP  	customer and have no access to SAPUI5. You can still use openUI5 at no cost  	for free with the exception of Fiori Elements.</p>
<p> 	So you can create Fiori apps even for non-SAP backends. And you can integrate  	them into your landscape next to all the other Fiori apps. This really raises  	the limits as to what you may achieve with Fiori.</p>
<h1>Checklist for decision</h1>
<ul>
<li>Is mobile access needed?</li>
<li>Can Fiori make the end users' routine task faster?</li>
<li>Can Fiori make the business process faster?</li>
<li>Is SAPGUI access not present?</li>
<li>Is RAP a suitable choice for the business case technically?</li>
<li>Do the end users use Fiori for everything?</li>
<li>Do you need something special on the UI?</li>
<li>Do you intend to integrate a third party system capable of OData?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is yes, then Fiori is a logical choice.</p>
