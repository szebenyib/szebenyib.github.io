&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://onespire.net/news/fiori-3-spaces-and-pages/"&gt;Onespire.net&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb347db2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgb347db2"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Fiori 1-2-3 - what is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SAP Fiori as a term has appeared around 2013. This is the time when the first Fiori apps have appeared. 25 to be precise. A long road has been taken since, with more and more customers embarking on their S/4 HANA and SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform) journey where this technology powers everyday operations relying on thousands of Fiori apps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Just as with any other IT solution Fiori evolves as well. The milestones of 1-2-3 refer not to the SAPUI5 toolkit on which Fiori is primarily based, but to bigger changes that reflect the overall user experience. For example Fiori 2 has introduced the viewport concept to empower the user with a multi-desktop like experience, along with the Belize theme, notifications, SAP CoPilot and the first iteration of the native SAP Fiori for iOS and Android.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To give a perspective as how fast this technology evolves the SAPUI5 toolkit has been in development since at least 2010 and it has had at least 107 releases up until 2022-11 (only a few selected are long term supported and suitable for productive use). In this time frame SAP Netweaver has had 8 releases, with S/4HANA only appearing at 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Although Fiori 3 was announced in 2018 it takes time to adapt it. And by the time adaptation has happened some parts had evolved as well - like the theme from Quartz to Horizon. Therefore I concentrate on today's state (as of 2022-11).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org7cd0296" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org7cd0296"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Fiori 3 - what does it bring to the table today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe that the first and most important aspect is unification. If you use SAP BTP you can see that products are getting more and more aligned regarding design and way of operation. Before this guideline was published SAP products had their own designs - they were similar, but they all worked at least a bit a differently. But with User Experience (UX) in focus SAP has to offer the same look and behaviour to its users so as to suggest that they use software belonging to each other. One company - one face - one design.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Besides unification there is a better integration of machine learning, and the appearance of conversational interfaces. Those topics deserve a discussion on their own, I would like to highlight two more tangible aspects of Fiori 3, namely the introduction of the spaces and pages concept and the Horizon theme.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org24fd782" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org24fd782"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-3"&gt;2.1.&lt;/span&gt; Spaces and pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org4706be3" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org4706be3"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.1.1.&lt;/span&gt; Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spaces and pages is the latest and greatest way how a Fiori Launchpad is to be organised.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you have been on the journey with SAP as Fiori Launchpad has evolved, you will know that Fiori Launchpad was not up to the task that it had to fulfill at its first releases. Long load times, browser issues and lagging all required fixing, which has been carried out by SAP. It is most likely that you are using a system that has none of these issues already. Yet it can be even better.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Spaces and pages offers you a three-tier organisation of your tiles. In contrast to the earlier setup, where you could only form groups from your tiles, this enables you to go further. You can still put your tiles into groups, but those are encapsulated into pages. Think of the previous Fiori Launchpad as having a single page. You can now have multiple of those. And to make the navigation between pages more organised, pages are kept together via spaces. In practice it means that the former bar, which contained groups will be like a combobox titled like the space containing all pages in its dropdown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgb787c56" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="orgb787c56"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.1.2.&lt;/span&gt; Who is affected?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spaces and pages became available with S/4HANA 2020 and since release 2021 it is &lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; way how Fiori Launchpad is ought to be used. Groups are officially deprecated as of S/4HANA 2021. As such anyone using S/4HANA or planning its transition to S/4HANA will need to proceed into this direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org52041bd" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org52041bd"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.1.3.&lt;/span&gt; Implications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Transitioning from groups to spaces and pages requires effort from the side of the organisation. But luckily there are tools to help and there is a possibility to make the rollout of this concept phased.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Enabling spaces and pages can be done via two approaches:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forcing everyone to use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making it opt-in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By favoring the latter approach a gradual implementation is possible. This means that even though spaces and pages is available to the end user, they have the option to disable it and get their groups back should the need arise. This can also help flattening the workload on the department responsible for authorizations because the old and new world can coexist - some divisions may be already using spaces and pages while others are only preparing for it. Once everyone uses spaces and pages and the daily operations are stable the option to go back to groups can be revoked from everyone by setting a table entry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This opt-in approach also allows system administrators to try out this concept and experiment with it in a development system without affecting anyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And how to 'install' spaces and pages? It comes with S/4HANA, it is already there. A simple configuration step of a wizard will take care of this in a second.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org9986640" class="outline-4"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="org9986640"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-4"&gt;2.1.4.&lt;/span&gt; Transition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The big picture has been outlined above, but what about the standard roles? What about existing groups? What about starting from scratch? What about existing roles?
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Let's go and tackle those one-by-one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a id="orga647a06"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Standard roles&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-1-4-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Standard roles come with a preconfigured spaces and pages. They can form the backbone of both an initial setup and a migration. If your organisation mostly relies on standard roles then copying those again and slightly modifying them to your needs will consume the least amount of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a id="orgcdbddff"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Existing groups&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-1-4-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your roles greatly deviate from the standard business roles then you may be best off migrating your groups into the new world. There is a tool for that and it allows you to create pages from existing groups. This can help make the transition faster but beware that once a page has been created there is no way to use this tool to add further contents of existing groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a id="org527b9a7"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Starting from scratch&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-1-4-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a general rule of thumb one should always put the end user and their daily activities first. Think about how they use the system, consult with them to make the most out of the implementation - and Fiori in general. If you missed the opportunity during an earlier implementation this is the time to make your system and users more efficient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a id="orgc5d123d"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Existing roles&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-1-4-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One should not be afraid of adding spaces to an existing role. They are different authorisation objects than groups, this is also the reason why groups and the spaces and pages concept can coexist. If the option is taken away from end users to go back to groups they will not be able to use it - they can safely remain in roles alongside with spaces.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgd2c9527" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgd2c9527"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-3"&gt;2.2.&lt;/span&gt; Horizon theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is not just the world of Fiori that keeps evolving and getting fine-grained to meet customer expectations based on UX research of SAP but the toolkit behind it as well. Actually the toolkit has been around since at least three years earlier then the first Fiori apps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part of the toolkit is also the theme. One may think that is a minor detail but comparing the impressions of the different versions will clearly make a point.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The newest theme - in the series of Blue Crystal, Belize, Quartz - is codenamed Horizon and aims to provide a fresh experience. One that is more aligned to what we are used to experience on our phones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The theme is being planned to be available for general use in Q1/2023, along with a preview in Q4/2022 - S/4HANA on premise. This can be translated to an availability coming with S/4HANA 2022, more precisely SAP Fiori Front-End Server (FES) for SAP S/4HANA 2022, which has been released this October.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The good news is that if you have not modified the standard theme and do not use custom controls this theme is ready to be used without further actions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org48085ad" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org48085ad"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SAP and its ERP system has started moving fast, a lot faster than before. But SAP is committed to keep S/4HANA stable all the while leaving room for new features to arrive. Fiori is not an exception, it gets better and better and by constantly paying attention to its evolution all organizations can leverage the latest and greatest UX SAP has to offer - with minimal effort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://onespire.net/news/s4-comes-with-fiori/"&gt;Onespire.net&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org6a94f05" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org6a94f05"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt; Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe it is fair to assume that every business that runs SAP has heard about Fiori. Even if there are clients firmly sticking to the ECC world they must have met Fiori on SAP TechEd or other events but at least they may have experienced it via the SAP Support Launchpad.
Some have started experimenting with selected Fiori applications, which cover their needs in a specific line of business. Others upgrade their ECC into an S/4 HANA system or are planning a greenfield S/4 implementation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
No matter which phase the client is in, sooner or later Fiori is introduced into the SAP landscape. The difference is the extent to which it becomes a factor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What one would normally say is that this happens step-by-step as the technology conquers more and more areas but that is no longer the case. When it comes to an S/4 implementation, Fiori will be there. It is unavoidable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That is why we have collected our experiences below so that you may come prepared for your encounter and make the most of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orga876f41" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orga876f41"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt; Fiori is nothing new but it is always ready to renew&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgf9073e0" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgf9073e0"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-3"&gt;2.1.&lt;/span&gt; Fiori is a must&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Concerning an S/4 implementation Fiori is a must. You cannot avoid it as applications and new features arrive via Fiori solutions, while traditional SAPGUI applications are gradually phased out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
According to our experiences SAPGUI shall be thought of as a tool for consultants. The daily workflow of the end user would not touch the SAPGUI under normal conditions but it would be based on accessing Fiori and Fiori-like applications in the web browser.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This means that Fiori applications, traditional ABAP reports with ALVs (in a generated form known as WebGUI or SAPGUI for HTML) and WebDynpros will be the interface between the end user and the SAP system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why would then not everything fit into a browser? Because some use cases rely on technologies not compatible with web browsers. SAP PPDS is a good example for such an exception as it has an important screen that is built on a special UI solution, which cannot be displayed via SAPGUI for HTML.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Should one want to observe the limitations of the WebGUI then please refer to the following notes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org530f20f" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org530f20f"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-3"&gt;2.2.&lt;/span&gt; Fiori is more than you think&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to the traditional definition Fiori is the UI that relies on the UI5 toolkit and adheres to the principles and guidelines that SAP has laid down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Whereas that may be one good interpretation it should be noted that no frontend stands on its own, it is coupled to a backend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So instead of just considering the UI let's look at the whole technology stack in an on premise implementation scenario. This is what you as a client will have to support on a daily basis to keep your operations going.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The initial distinction that is to be made is that not everything that the end user sees as Fiori is actually Fiori. As noted above it may be an analytic query powered by Embedded Analytics, a WebDynpro application as an ambassador of ancient times, a legacy ALV report or an actual UI5/Fiori app.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Going one step further and focusing just on the UI5 toolkit one can categorize the applications into freestyle and Fiori element applications. The former group uses javascript, xml and other dependent web technologies during development to come to the desired solution regarding UI and ABAP regarding backend. This allows catering for unique needs and designs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However the Pareto principle is effective here as well, 80 percent of the solutions follow the same analogy so why develop the same layout over and over again for a similar task? That is where Fiori Elements comes into the play as it allows to use metadata annotations to generate the layout in the backend instead of imperatively implementing it in the frontend in different html, css and javascript files.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This latter technology is most likely built on CDS views with ABAP mixed in at some point (with a few javascript exit possibilities on the UI side).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To go even further the backend part may follow implementations of the ABAP Programming Model for SAP Fiori or embrace even newer ways of ABAP Restful Programming Model that relies on a concept analogous to Business Objects Processing Framework (BOPF).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a result, the traditional approach of having one-developer-to-rule-them-all is void. Fiori requires a different mind- and toolset than what is present in the ABAP world today. SAP has started evolving technologies at a previously unprecedented rate, it is not just the number of supported business processes, which grow release by release but the available technical ways as well. Therefore some developers will embrace UI technologies, some will specialize in the backend stack and a few will have a good overall understanding of both. Not every technology is for everyone. This will lead to a
change in:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what kind of expertise is needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how many people will be able to cover the technology stack to provide the needed support for the backbone IT solution of your business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org8825279" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org8825279"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-3"&gt;2.3.&lt;/span&gt; Fiori is not the enemy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Based on the picture depicted above one may believe that S/4 is unnecessarily complicated from a technology perspective. Yes, it is more complex due to evolutionary reasons than an ECC but it can be tamed. Technology can be learned. We have already trained clients in Fiori and I have no doubt that they will be capable of tackling Fiori related issues and developments as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If that process is started in time then I see no reason why this would be less manageable than any other non-SAP custom solution which is realised by a symbiosis of different technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What is more, learning Fiori can be started even in a non S/4 environment with selected applications or a single custom development or even with a cloud based instance, which does not require significant upfront costs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org14d24d5" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org14d24d5"&gt;&lt;span class="section-number-2"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt; Prepare for it and use it as a leverage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why all the hassle? Because Fiori brings capabilities with it that no one could have dreamt of in an ECC world without third party solutions. Do you want to use your phone to approve a purchase order? Do you want to have reports available on your iPad? Do you want to have an overview of how well your suppliers perform this month, all aspects on a single page in an easy to consume graphical format? No problem, S/4 comes with batteries included. And if you want more, the door is open for further custom development be it just a report or a whole app that focuses on your unique process.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What you may do as a preparation:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discover the Fiori Launchpad and its capabilities, including authorization aspects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that new backend technology knowledge is available: new ABAP syntax, learn and understand object oriented programming, CDS, ABAP Restful Programming Model known as RAP, or in case of cloud check the Cloud Application Programming Model known as CAP as well, Eclipse with ABAP Development Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that new frontend technology knowledge is available: Fiori Design Guidelines, UI5 toolkit, UI5 tooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn how the development process differs from an ABAP development (design thinking, wireframes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use the freely available openSAP courses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get to know the SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement an application that is available for your existing landscape, refer to the Fiori Apps Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;develop a Fiori application to get a real insight into the possibilities and start mastering the nuts and bolts of the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note that most of the above has something to show not just for developers but consultants as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They also have to learn how a Fiori app specification can and should be provided and what they may expect from the technology. The above journey may take some time so it is best to start embarking right now even if your organization does not intend to use S/4 in the next year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With great power comes great responsibility – this is true in the case of Fiori. Compared to what is available in an ECC system both in speed, line of business solutions and user experience one cannot mention the old and the new world on the same page. But in order to leverage the possibilities it is best to prepare ourselves for the transition and have a concept ready to flatten the waves and ensure smooth sailing so that we may enjoy the sunshine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
